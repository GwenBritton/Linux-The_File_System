|||challenge
A new `test-website/config/` directory has been created.

Evaluate your `mv` command understanding for moving files and directories by:

1. Moving the `test-website/config/` directory to the `~/workspace` directory
1. Moving the `test-website/.website-config` dotfile to the `~/workspace/config/` directory.

__TIP:__ Optimize your time by performing the aforementioned instructions directly from your `~/workspace` directory.
