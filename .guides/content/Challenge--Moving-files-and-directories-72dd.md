## Applying the `mv` command to move files 

|||challenge
Evaluate your `mv` command understanding for moving files and directories by executing the command:

```
bashtest move-test
```

### Some files are not being displayed on the file tree after the challenge was passed

Don't worry. If this happens: 

1. Make sure that the `ls` command actually lists the files and directories inside your correspondent directory
2. If the files exist, go to Codio's top bar and do: 

__*Project > Resync File Tree*__

You should be seeing the files on the file tree now.
