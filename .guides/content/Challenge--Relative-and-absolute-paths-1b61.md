## Ready for this challenge?

|||challenge
The terminal window wants to evaluate your current _bash_ knowledge by using the `~/workspace/nested-directories` folder. 

Execute the following command directly from the `~/workspace` directory path:

```
bashtest paths-test
```

__NOTE:__ Keyboard shortcuts may not work during challenges as they are running on a _bash interactive screen_.

|||info
### Some files are not being displayed on the file tree after the challenge was passed

Don't worry. If this happens: 

1. Make sure that the `ls` command actually lists the files and directories inside your correspondent directory
2. If the files exist, go to Codio's top bar and do: 

__*Project > Resync File Tree*__

You should be seeing the files on the file tree now.
