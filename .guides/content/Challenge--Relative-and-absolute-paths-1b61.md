The terminal window wants to evaluate your current _bash_ knowledge by using the `~/workspace/nested-directories` folder:

1. `cd` into the `nested-directories/nested-level-1/` directory by using an _absolute path_
1. `cd` into the `nested-level-3/` directory by using a _relative path_
1. Move the entire `~/workspace/config/` directory to the `nested-level-1/` directory
