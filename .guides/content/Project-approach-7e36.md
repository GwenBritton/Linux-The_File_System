## Simplifying our web project directory structure

In the last unit, our `~/workspace` directory was left with the following structure:

```
~/workspace
-- assets
--- img
---- logo.png
-- css
--- styles.css
-- test-website
--- img
---- logo.png
--- index.html
index.html
```

In this unit we are going to focus on taking back one level some files and directories as well as copying some files and directories to our _test-website_ directory. Among some CLI productivity tricks.
